# Eight-queens-puzzle
The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8 Ã— 8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

The program is implemented in Qt Creator.

The purpose is to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface, to implement the method of placing the queen on the board, subject to the conditions of the problem, and the method of back-waste.
